# LineChart from <Minh Nguyen, nvnminh0@gmail.com>. 
This code demonstrate a way to build your own line chart without using any third-party library. It contains a simple yet effective algorithm to build a curved line through a set of points. I don't recommend you to import LineChart.swift directly into your project because it is build for demonstration purpose only. However, you should modify it according to your needs.

So I've adapted LineChart from <Minh Nguyen, nvnminh0@gmail.com>.  Thank you sir or ma'am.

I'm trying to track chronic pain and chronic migraines as they relate to barometric pressure changes (Delta).  From this basic mash-up I'd develope a method to do self assessments.  Share this info with my Nuerologist/Chronic pain doc.
Long way to go from here.
